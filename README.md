about this project

This Python script is a versatile data cleaning tool designed to automate the process of cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis. 
It works with both CSV and Excel files, detecting duplicate records, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity. 
The code provides informative outputs at each step, guiding users through the cleaning process.

The script includes key features such as:
1, Supports Multiple File Types: Handles both .csv and .xlsx file formats for data input.
2. Duplicate Handling: Detects, saves, and removes duplicate records from the dataset.
3. Missing Value Management: Fills missing values in numeric columns with the mean and drops rows with missing values in non-numeric columns.
4. Path Verification: Checks if the provided file path exists and returns appropriate messages for incorrect paths.
5. Automated Data Cleaning: Cleans the data without requiring repeated code execution.
6. Data Export: Exports the cleaned data into a new CSV file.
7. Simulated Processing Delays: Adds random wait times to simulate real-time processing, enhancing user interaction
